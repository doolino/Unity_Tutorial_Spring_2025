    ** Withdraw Money (ensure balance doesn't go negative)
    ** Exit
 *
 *
 * 
 * Example 1
 * Input:
   ATM Menu:
   1. Check Balance
   2. Deposit Money
   3. Withdraw Money
   4. Exit
   Choose an option: 1
   
   Output: Your balance is $0
   
 * Example 2
 * Input:
   ATM Menu:
   1. Check Balance
   2. Deposit Money
   3. Withdraw Money
   4. Exit
   Choose an option: 2
   Enter the amount to deposit: 100
   
 * Output: You have deposited $100. Your new balance is: $100
 *
 *
 * Example 3
 * Input:
   ATM Menu:
   1. Check Balance
   2. Deposit Money
   3. Withdraw Money
   4. Exit
   Choose an option: 3
   Enter the amount to withdraw: 50
   
 * Output: You have withdrawn $50. Your new balance is: $50
 *
 *
 * Example 4
 * Input:
   ATM Menu:
   1. Check Balance
   2. Deposit Money
   3. Withdraw Money
   4. Exit
   Choose an option: 3
   Enter the amount to withdraw: 100
   
 * Output: Insufficient funds. Withdrawal denied.
 *
 *
 * Example 5
 * Input:
   ATM Menu:
   1. Check Balance
   2. Deposit Money
   3. Withdraw Money
   4. Exit
   Choose an option: 4
   
 * Output: Thank you for using the ATM. Goodbye!

///////////////////// Arrays /////////////////////
 
/* Problem 1
 * 
 * Declare and initialize two arrays of integers.
 * Merge them into a single array.
 * Sort the merged array in ascending order.
 * Print the final sorted array.
 *
 * Solve this problem using array methods and also solve it without using array methods.
 */

/* With Array Method */

int[] array1 = [1, 2, 3, 4];
int[] array2 = [5, 6, 7, 8];
int[] array3 = new int[array1.Length + array2.Length];

array1.CopyTo(array3,0);
array2.CopyTo(array3,array1.Length);
Array.Sort(array3);
Console.WriteLine(array3);

/* Without Array Method */



/* Problem 2
 * 
 * Declare and initialize an arrays of integers.
 * Declare a variable for a target number.
 * Find the first index where the number appears.
 * Find the last index where the number appears.
 * If the number is not in the array, return -1 for both indices.
 * Print both indices.
 *
 * Solve this problem using array methods and also solve it without using array methods.
 */

int[] array4 = [2,2,2,2,2,5,2,2,2,2,5,2];
int target = 5;
int FirstIndex = Array.FindIndex(array4, target);
int LastIndex = Array.LastIndexOf(array4, target);
Console.WriteLine("Concatenated Indexes: " + FirstIndex + "" + LastIndex);


/* Problem 3
 * 
 * Ask user to enter integers separated by commas (,) and store them in an array. 
 * Remove all even numbers and sort the remaining numbers in ascending order.
 * Print the modified array.
 *
 * Example 1:
 * Input: Enter integers separated by commas: 5,10,3,8,15,2,11,6
 * Output: [3,5,11,15]
 *
 * Example 2:
 * Input: Enter integers separated by commas: 4,7,9,12,13,18,21
 * Output: [7,9,13,21]
 *
 *
 *
 * Hint 1: Try using Split() method to break a string into substrings. https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.string.split?view=net-9.0
 *
 * 
 * Hint 2: Try using Joint() method to concatenate the string representation of an array using a specified separator between each element. https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.string.join?view=net-9.0
 */
 









/* Problem 4
 * 
 * Ask user to enter integers separated by commas (,) and store them in an array.
 * Determine which number appears the most times.
 * If there are multiple numbers with the same highest frequency, return the smallest one.
 * Print the most frequently occurring number.
 *
 * Example 1:
 * Input: Enter integers separated by commas: 1,3,2,1,4,1,2,3,2
 * Output: Number 1 appears 3 time(s).
 * Explanation: The number 1 appears 3 times, which is the highest frequency.
 *
 * Example 2:
 * Input: Enter integers separated by commas: 4,5,4,6,5,6,5,6
 * Output: Number 5 appears 3 time(s).
 * Explanation: Both 5 and 6 appear 3 times, but 5 is the smallest number among them.
 *
 * Example 3:
 * Input: Enter integers separated by commas: 1,2,3,4,5
 * Output: Number 1 appears 1 time(s).
 * Explanation: Number 1 is the smallest number among them and it appears once.
 *
 *
 */








/* Problem 5
 * 
 * Ask user to enter integers separated by commas (,) and store them in an array.
 * Replace all negative numbers with their absolute values.
 * Remove all numbers greater than 100.
 * Sort the final array in ascending order.
 * Print the modified array.
 *
 * Example 1:
 * Input: Enter integers separated by commas: 3,-1,105,-50,70,200,-300,5
 * Output: [1,3,5,50,70]
 * 
 *
 * Example 2:
 * Input: Enter integers separated by commas: -10,20,150,-25,45,110,-90,7
 * Output: [7,10,20,25,45,90]
 * 
 *
 *
 */








/* Problem 6
 * 
 * Ask user to enter integers separated by commas (,) and store them in an array.
 * Ask user to enter an integer N.
 * Shift all elements to the right by N positions, wrapping elements that move past the end back to the start.
 * Print the final array.
 *
 * Example 1:
 * Input: Enter integers separated by commas: 1,2,3,4,5
 * Input: Enter an integer for N: 2
 * Output: [4,5,1,2,3]
 * Explanation: The elements are shifted 2 positions to the right. The last 2 elements (4 and 5) wrap around to the start.
 *
 *
 * Example 2:
 * Input: Enter integers separated by commas: 5,10,15,20,25,30
 * Input: Enter an integer for N: 5
 * Output: [10,15,20,25,30,5]
 * Explanation: The elements are shifted 5 positions to the right. The last 5 elements (10, 15, 20, 25, 30) wrap around to the start.
